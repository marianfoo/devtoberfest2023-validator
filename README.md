# Devtoberfest Badges Checker

**Note: This README and the accompanying script were generated by an AI language model.**

## Overview

The "Devtoberfest Badges Checker" is a Bash script designed to retrieve and match badges earned during the Devtoberfest 2023 event. It checks the availability of the "pup" command and installs it if necessary. Using the SAP People API, it fetches badge information based on a given SCN ID or prompts the user for input. The script then compares the obtained badges with the Week 1 badges extracted from a SAP Community blog post. It displays the matched badges with a "✅" symbol and non-matching badges with an "❌" symbol.

## bash 

### Prerequisites

To use this script, ensure you have the following:

- The "pup" command installed. If not found, the script attempts to install it using Homebrew.
- If Homebrew is unavailable, refer to the official [pup GitHub repository](https://github.com/ericchiang/pup) for manual installation instructions.

### Usage

Execute the script using the following command:

```bash
bash <script_name>.sh [-u <scnId>]
Command-line options:
 • ﻿-u <scnId>: Specifies the SCN ID to retrieve the badges. If not provided, the script will prompt for input.
Example
bash devtoberfest.sh -u john_doe
or
bash devtoberfest.sh
Enter a SCN ID: john_doe
Output
The script will display a list of badges earned for Week 1 of Devtoberfest 2023. Each badge will be marked with a "✅" symbol if earned or an "❌" symbol if not earned.
Example output:
✅ #Badge1
❌ #Badge2
✅ #Badge3
```

Please note that this script is specifically tailored for the Devtoberfest 2023 event and may not work as expected for other scenarios or events.

### node 

To use the Node.js version of the Devtoberfest Badges Checker, follow the instructions below:

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your system. If not, download and install them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

#### Installation

In your project directory, install the required dependencies using the following command:

#### Usage

To execute the Node.js script, use the following command in your terminal, replacing `<scnId>` with the SCN ID you want to check:

```

or directly with node:

```sh
node index.js -u <scnId>
```

For example:

```sh
node index.js -u mariannnn

#### Output

The script will compare the badges from the SAP People API against the badges listed in the JSON file and will display a list of badges with a "✅" symbol for earned badges and a "❌" symbol for unearned badges.
